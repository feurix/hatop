What is HATop?
==============

HATop's appearance is similar to top(1). It supports various modes
for detailed statistics of all configured proxies and services in near
realtime. In addition, it features an interactive CLI for the haproxy
unix socket. This allows administrators to control the given haproxy
instance (change server weight, put servers into maintenance mode, ...)
directly out of hatop and monitor the results immediately.

*It is important to understand that when multiple haproxy processes are started
on the same socket, any process may pick up the request and thus hatop will
output stats owned solely by that process.  The current haproxy-internal
process id is displayed top right.*


Command line options
--------------------
::

  $ hatop --help
  Usage: hatop [options]

  Options:
    --version             show program's version number and exit
    -h, --help            show this help message and exit

    Mandatory:
      -s SOCKET, --unix-socket=SOCKET
                          path to the haproxy unix socket

    Optional:
      -i INTERVAL, --update-interval=INTERVAL
                          update interval in seconds (1-30, default: 3)
      -m MODE, --mode=MODE
                          start in specific mode (1-5, default: 1)
      -n, --read-only     disable the cli and query for stats only

    Filters:
      Note: All filter options may be given multiple times.

      -f FILTER, --filter=FILTER
                          stat filter in format "<iid> <type> <sid>"
      -p PROXY, --proxy=PROXY
                          proxy filter in format "<pxname>"


Display mode reference
----------------------
::

  ID  Mode    Description

  1   STATUS  The default mode with health, session and queue statistics
  2   TRAFFIC Display connection and request rates as well as traffic stats
  3   HTTP    Display various statistical information related to HTTP
  4   ERRORS  Display health info, various error counters and downtimes
  5   CLI     Display embedded command line client for the unix socket

Keybind reference
-----------------
::

  Key             Action

  Hh?             Display this help screen
  TAB             Cycle through all modes
  ESC-ESC         Jump to previous mode
  ALT-n / ESC-n   Switch to mode n, where n is the numeric mode id
  CTRL-C / Qq     Quit

You can scroll the stat views using ``UP / DOWN / PGUP / DOWN / HOME / END``.

The reverse colored cursor line is used to select a given service instance.

An unique identifier ``[IID=<proxy id> SID=<service id>]`` of the selected
service is displayed bottom right. You can hit ``SPACE`` to copy and paste the
identifier to the CLI for easy re-use with some commands. For example:

1. Open the CLI
2. Type "disable server "
3. Switch back to some stat view
4. Select the server instance
5. Hit SPACE

The result is this command line::

    > disable server #<iid>/#<sid>

Hotkeys for common administrative actions
-----------------------------------------
::

  Hotkey      Action

  F4          Restore initial server weight

  F5          Decrease server weight:     - 10
  F6          Decrease server weight:     -  1
  F7          Increase server weight:     +  1
  F8          Increase server weight:     + 10

  F9          Enable server (return from maintenance mode)
  F10         Disable server (put into maintenance mode)

Hotkey actions and server responses are logged on the CLI viewport.

You can scroll the output on the CLI view using ``PGUP / PGDOWN``.

A brief keybind reference is logged there directly after startup...
